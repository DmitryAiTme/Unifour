      <p>Flipso, Postix, Devix, and Teachy are clever AI Agents built to boost your trading journey.</p>
      <p>But hey — even smart bots have their “oops” moments. Sometimes they might suggest something that’s... let’s say, less than ideal.</p>
      <p>So please double-check important info before making big moves. Remember, the Agents are here to help, not to babysit your portfolio (yet). </p>
